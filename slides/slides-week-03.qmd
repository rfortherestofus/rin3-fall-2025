## Housekeeping

- We are working on getting email notifications when you **submit** assignments

# Data Viz Questions {.inverse}

## Color vs fill

> Why is it that the color= option is treated differently by geom_point and geom_col? The logic seems inconsistent here since "color=" is used as if it is "fill =" by geom_point. What if I want the scatter plot to have black dots with outline color different by island?

## Applying values specific color/fill properties

> When using scale_color_manual, do you need to specify the order in which colors are applied to a certain category? I assume it matters. How will I know which colors are being applied to specific data?
