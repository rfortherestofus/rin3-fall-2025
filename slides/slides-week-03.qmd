1. Co-working session next week will be **Monday** instead of Tuesday (same time)

# Example Projects {.inverse}

# Data Viz Tips {.inverse}

## Color vs fill

> Why is it that the color= option is treated differently by geom_point and geom_col? The logic seems inconsistent here since "color=" is used as if it is "fill =" by geom_point. What if I want the scatter plot to have black dots with outline color different by island?

## Applying values specific color/fill properties

> When using scale_color_manual, do you need to specify the order in which colors are applied to a certain category? I assume it matters. How will I know which colors are being applied to specific data?

## Labels vs breaks

> Why is this code showing the text 152 above the y axis text 120?

  count(species)

ggplot(
  penguins_by_species,
  aes(
    x = species,
    y = n,
    fill = species,
    label = n
  )
) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 200),
    labels = c(0, 40, 80, 120, 160)
  ) +
  geom_label(vjust = 1.5, color = "white")
```

# Next Week

You'll be learning about Quarto!

- Course assignment: learn the basics of Quarto

- Project assignment: take what you've done so far and turn it into a Quarto document
