Think about unit of analysis

Try to plot your data and if you can't, it's probably not tidy
:::

## Tidy Data Rule #1: Every Column is a Variable {.inverse}

---

```{r}
#| echo: false

life_expectancy_over_time <-
  gapminder::gapminder |>
  mutate(country = as.character(country)) |>
  select(country, year, lifeExp) |>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = country,
    names_from = year,
    values_from = lifeExp
  ) |>
  slice(1:10)
```

```{r}
life_expectancy_over_time
```

---

```{r}
life_expectancy_over_time |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country,
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "life_expectancy"
  )
```

## Tidy Data Rule #3: Every Cell is a Single Value {.inverse}

---

```{r}
#| echo: false
my_addresses <-
  tribble(
    ~time_period,
    ~address,
    "Childhood",
    "537 Westdale Avenue, Swarthmore, PA, 19801",
    "Childhood",
    "690 Omar Circle, Yellow Springs, OH, 45387",
    "Grad School",
    "3809 Meade Avenue, San Diego, CA, 92116"
  )
```

```{r}
my_addresses
```

---

```{r}
my_addresses |>
  separate_wider_delim(
    cols = address,
    delim = ", ",
    names = c("street", "city", "state", "zip_code")
  )
```

## Tidy Data Rule #2: Every Row is an Observation {.inverse}

::: {.notes}
Select all that apply question

Think about unit of analysis
:::

---

```{r}
#| echo: false
favorite_sports <-
  tribble(
    ~name,
    ~favorite_sport,
    "David",
    "Soccer, Basketball",
    "Elias",
    "Baseball, Soccer, Skiing",
    "Leila",
    "Aerial Dance, Roller Skating",
    "Rachel",
    "Soccer, Baseball"
  )
```

```{r}
favorite_sports
```

---

```{r}
favorite_sports |>
  separate_longer_delim(
    cols = favorite_sport,
    delim = ", "
  )
```



## Tidy Data Question

> When working with "select all that apply" variables in the past in datasets where one row = one individual, I've typically dealt with this by converting each response option to its own column where a 1 ("yes") is present if that response option was selected. This has worked well for my purposes, but I understand now that it violates Tidy Data Rule 1 because a single variable is spread across multiple columns. Am I understanding correctly that while the approach I've used in the paste is not inherently better or worse than tidy format, the advantage to making it tidy is that it will be easier to analyze using tidyverse? Is this still true if the unit of analysis I'm interested in is the individual and not the activity (for example)?
